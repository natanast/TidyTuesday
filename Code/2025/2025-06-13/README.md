# Project Gutenberg

This week we're exploring books from Project Gutenberg and the {[gutenbergr](https://docs.ropensci.org/gutenbergr/)} R package!

> [{gutenbergr} allows you to] Download and process public domain works in the 
> Project Gutenberg collection <https://www.gutenberg.org/>. Includes metadata 
> for all Project Gutenberg works, so that they can be searched and retrieved.

- How many different languages are available in the Project Gutenberg collection? How many books are available in each language?
- Do any authors appear under more than one `gutenberg_author_id`?
- How might the {gutenbergr} package authors further refine the data for greater ease-of-use?

Thank you to [Jon Harmon, Data Science Learning Community](https://github.com/jonthegeek) for curating this week's dataset.
