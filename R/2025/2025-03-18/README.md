# Long Beach Animal Shelter

This week we're exploring the [Long Beach Animal Shelter Data](https://data.longbeach.gov/explore/dataset/animal-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes/information/)! 

The dataset comes from the [City of Long Beach Animal Care Services](https://www.longbeach.gov/acs/) via the [{animalshelter}](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/animalshelter/) R package.

> This dataset comprises of the intake and outcome record from Long Beach Animal Shelter.

- How has the number of pet adoptions changed over the years?
- Which type of pets are adopted most often?

Thank you to [Lydia Gibson](https://github.com/lgibson7) for curating this week's dataset.
