# The Scent of Data - Exploring the Parfumo Fragrance Dataset

This week we're diving into the fascinating world of fragrances with a dataset sourced from [Parfumo](https://www.parfumo.com/), a vibrant community of perfume enthusiasts.  [Olga G.](https://www.kaggle.com/olgagmiufana1) webscraped these data from the various fragrance sections on the Parfumo website. Here is a description from the author:

> This dataset contains detailed information about perfumes sourced from Parfumo, obtained through web scraping. It includes data on perfume ratings, olfactory notes (top, middle, and base notes), perfumers, year of release and other relevant characteristics of the perfumes listed on the Parfumo website.

> The data provides a comprehensive look at how various perfumes are rated, which families of scents they belong to, and detailed breakdowns of the key olfactory components that define their overall profile

Weâ€™ll explore how perfumes are rated, uncover the scent families they belong to, and delve into the minds of the perfumers behind them. From the year of release to the delicate composition of each scent, this dataset offers a rich olfactory experience for anyone curious about the magic behind their favorite perfumes.
